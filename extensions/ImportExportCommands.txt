1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/PomeZzz/GNOME-Extensions-Backup-Script
cd File location

2. Make the script executable

chmod +x gnome-extensions-config.sh

3. Export your current extensions config

./gnome-extensions-config.sh export

This will create a file called extensions.conf in the same directory.
4. Import it back later

./gnome-extensions-config.sh import
